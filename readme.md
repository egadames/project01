###Project Planning: 
Our website is the most convenient way to search events going on near you!
browse restaurants, bars, movies, concerts, and outdoor options all within your zip code or surrounding area. save the ones you are interested in and start building your excursion itinerary. 

### App's Concept: 
We created our site to make it easy to planning outings,
figure out where to eat, or just find a reason to get out of the house and have some fun.
### Process:  
What were the technologies used? 
            we utilized multiple API to source our calendar events and populate our site along with allowing us to append events to a calendar
            
How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? 
            we each will take charge of an event genre to start ex: food or movies or trails etc.
